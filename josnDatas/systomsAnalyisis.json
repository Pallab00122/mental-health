While mild anxiety can be normal and even helpful in some situations, excessive or chronic anxiety can become a mental health disorder, leading to significant distress and impairment in daily life. Common symptoms of anxiety include racing thoughts, restlessness, muscle tension, and a sense of impending danger or doom.
